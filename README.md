VectorVictor: go do some math
=============================

Mostly just for learning, but a little API for doing some simple vector
manipulations (any maybe some matrix stuff later on). To start with, it 
will be very norm-based, because norms are neat.

Uses gin and go-thrust to package as a webkit desktop app.

To run:

    go build -v -o vectorvictor main.go
    ./vectorvictor
